# 4fea5665 The Role of Decoders in Language Recognition with RNNs

## Content
Decoders enhance the language recognition capability of RNNs by interpreting their final hidden states. While rational recurrence limits RNNs like QRNNs in recognizing complex languages such as a[n]b[n], employing multi-layer or more complex decoders can bridge this gap. No single-layer QRNN can independently recognize a[n]b[n] without additional decoder depth. This highlights the transformative role of decoders in transcending RNN limitations in language tasks.
