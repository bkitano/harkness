# 8cad2f85 Understanding WFAs and Their Relation to RNNs

## Content
Weighted Finite-state Automata (WFAs) are defined for encoding strings with weighted transitions and states. A function can be represented by a WFA if its associated Hankel matrix has finite rank, characterizing it as a rational series. RNNs like Elman and GRU can effectively model WFAs for rational series, but cannot achieve the complex counting akin to LSTMs due to their finite space and rational limitations.
